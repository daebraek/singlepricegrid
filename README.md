## My process

Used Flexbox to create the main layout. Also used it for the mobile layout. Looking back now maybe I should have used grid but it is what it is.

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned a lot about media queries and using chrome dev tools to aid my development process

### Continued development

Flexbox concept/media queries are still not entirely understandable at the moment. Might get into learning bootstrap soon but I have to maintain a complete understand of plain CSS first.

### Useful resources
